# Interview Revision: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This file contains my revision of Algorithms and data structure, for interview revision
The code is written in c#, such that most of it can be reused to implement in Java

## Source Materials
- ### For kick starts,  you can refer the following [document](http://lib.mdp.ac.id/ebook/Karya%20Umum/Dsa.pdf) written by Granville Barnett, and Luca Del Tongo.
  - This document provides a quick and easy explanation of most common data structure and Algorithm.
